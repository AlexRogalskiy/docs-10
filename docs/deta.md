title: About Deta
---

Deta is a cloud platform (we like to call it a "cloud computer") crafted with the developer and user experience at heart.

Deta is borne by the belief, and bitter experience, that a lot of seemingly small ideas &mdash; though quite useful &mdash; are sitting on the sidelines. We think the dual experiences of *"getting to app"* and *"using and interacting with the app"* on current clouds is way too complicated for these ideas.

It is our mission is to dramatically reduce the gap between these ideas and working applications.

To accomplish this, we offer a set of minimal-config cloud primitives, letting you (and others, if you want) focus on:

1. Building your application logic
2. Using your app


[Deta Base](Base), our NoSQL database, is our first product.
