title: About Deta
---

Deta is a cloud computer crafted with the developer and user experience at heart.

Deta is borne by the belief, and bitter experience, that a lot of seemingly small ideas--though quite useful--are sitting on the sidelines. We think the dual experiences of *"getting to app"* and *"using and interacting with the app"* on current cloud providers is way too complicated relative to how small these ideas initially seem.

It is our mission is to dramatically reduce the gap between these ideas and working, user friendly, applications.

To accomplish this, we offer a set of cloud primitives, handle most of the config for these primitives, and let you focus on:

1. Building your application logic
2. Enabling you (and others, if you want), to easily use your app.
