Base UI let's you inspect, add, modify and delete records from a Base via a GUI.

### Opening Base UI

You can open an individual Base's UI within any project by clicking on the Base name in the project sidebar.

All the data from your Base should load into the table view when clicked. You can edit individual cells, if they do not contain an array or an object.

### Advanced Editing

You can expand any cell if you want to do advanced editing (like the editing of objects and arrays or type changes).

### Queries

If you don't want to deal with all of your data at once, you can use Deta Base's queries to get a filtered view. Click the **Query** button, enter your query, and hit enter or click **Fetch**.
