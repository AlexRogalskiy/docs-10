Drive UI lets you inspect, add, delete files from a Drive via a GUI.

### Opening Drive UI

You can open an individual Drive's UI within any project by clicking on the Drive name in the project sidebar.

All the files and folders from within the path `/` should load into the table view when clicked. 


### Preview and Navigation

Files that are previewable (and folders) are marked in blue.

Clicking a folder will navigate to that folder, while clicking a file will open up a preview.

Your current location is highlighted in black in the navigation bar at the top of Drive UI.

You can click a parent folder, or the Drive name, to jump to that location.

### Uploading & Downloading Files

You can upload a file by dragging it into the list of files & folders. This will upload the file in the current directory.
